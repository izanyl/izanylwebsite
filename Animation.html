						<h2 class="fh5co-heading">3D Mapping Animation for Unreal Engine Project</h2>
						<p>This basics of this project were to learn and understand the power of UX & UI interfaces. Before doing the project, we were asked to reasearch and create presentations on 3D platforms such as Unity 3D, Unreal Engine, and Virtual Reality. 
							After doing those steps, we were then asked to select a 3D platform and create an enhanced 3D world experience based on imaged postcards that were available to us in the Fresno State Library database. The majority of the postcards contained either nature, buildings, or monuments based in the California.</p>
							<p>This would have been my first time working with Unity, Unreal Engine or VR, which of course it worked out in the end. I decided to use Unreal Engine and watched many tutorials on how to create a 3D environment. I looked up many textures, 3d objects, sounds, and other assets in order to create this project. I enjoyed the outcome, however, I did run into storage issues often since UE consists of large files and needs a lot of RAM in order to process. I had to uninstall many programs that I had in order to do this single project. If I had more space, I would have done more, for sure!

						<p>The assignment for this project was to look for a poem and create a kinetc type video out of it. I randomly selected a poem called 'Hope is the Thing with Feathers' by Emily Dickinson. The summary of the poem is that hope is like a bird that lives inside of us. Meaning, hope is always within us, through tough times and simple times. *Keywords: Storm, Chillest Land, and Strangest Sea*. The video had to be less than 45 seconds so it can be a little rushed but I tried my best  to match the motion graphics to the scenary of the phrases. </p>

					<h2 class="fh5co-heading">Short Timelapse</h2>
						<p>Our objective was to create a short and simple video that can express and show a timelapse of anything. I decided to stick with the timelapse of a butterfly. Their life span is short, so that is how I got the idea! Throughout the video, I first showed the stages of a caterpillar hanging from a branch, in order for the cocoon process to start. I quickly show the transitions of the cocoon and eventually show the butter flying off into the distance, once it emerges from the cocoon stage. Everything was created in Illustrator, so everything is a layer - and then animated in After Effects.</p>

					<h2 class="fh5co-heading">Smart Watch App</h2>
						<p>Idea for this project was simple; Create a smart watch app related to health or physical activity. I decided to propose and create the idea of a smart watch app that can make 
							and ehance engaging acivities for people interested to be outdoors. It is basically based on choosing an area or ecosystem near you and engage in bird sightings. With each month having a new objective as well as it keeping track of your physical activity such as steps and burned colories.
							App was designed in Figma.

					<h2 class="fh5co-heading">Run 4 Fun | Exercising Idea Proposal</h2>
						<p>Here we have another exercising idea project that was suppose to include some sort of interface, with the use of either Virtual Reality or Augmented Reailty. I decided to do something based on Augmented Reality. My idea proposal was to make running more fun. In this case, if you see the video, you can see how I would like to input large screens into a treadmill and include 'runnin' games into the treadmill. This will not only encourage people to run, but to also look forward into trying to beat the highscore of someone else who also uses a game in a treadmill.
							You know!? To make running more fun!

					<h2 class="fh5co-heading">Fit Check App |  Exercising Idea Proposal</h2>
						<p>And last but not least, ANOTHER Exercising idea app! My idea on this project was to create an application where useres are able to select a gym of their choice and view how many people were there (real life time). This can help people know just how packed a gym can be instead of going to the gym and finding a lot of people. Not only that, but the users will also know what training equipments are being used! As well as setting up appoinments with trainers too.</p>
