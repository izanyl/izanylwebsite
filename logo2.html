					<h2 class="fh5co-heading">IVA Eyes</h2>
						<p>As a viewer can tell, I like to work with art based on the eyes. It can be the eyes of a person, animal or insect. This Design was created in 2019 when I was working around with a design of a girl. I asked to myself, why am I so focused on the eyes? 
							That is when I realized that eyes are everything. They are powerful and they can express an emotion. A person can roll their eyes thus telling us that they are fed up or annoyed; a person can look down while walking and they can look serious; a person can cry either of joy, sadness, or anger. That is how powerful our body and eyes are expressive.</p>
							<p> I decided to draw and jigsaw this design in my BFA Board because it was simpler to cut out and the eyes looked more menacing. Also, since I would like to make this a Secondary logo for my identity, and of course I had to make them appear blue!

					<div class="col-md-6 animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInLeft">
					<h2 class="fh5co-heading">Owl VA Eyes (original logo)</h2>
					<p> This was my first design. Everything was done by shapes. I find bird eyes to be interesting as well. A pigeon does not have menacing eyes, but an eagle or owl does. Since owls are mysterious and shady, I chose to do the eyes based off an owl, the eyebrows based off a female, and the V A are supposed to be facial features: outline of the nose and the unibrow area. There are small features about me as well; the eyebrow thats cut off since I have a scar in one of my eyebrows; the Eyes to represent the letter 'i' the V and A to represent the other letters in my name (ivan). I decided to leave the letter 'N' since I did not know where to place it. Basically, I was inspired by my name when I was doing this design. </a></li></p>
					<p>The drippy design/shape underneath the eyes came from another design that I had worked with. The drippy effect in the letters and the eyes have to correlate with each other. As if the eyes are bleeding, and so are the letters. This drippy effect is also featured in other artwork that I have done.</p>

					<h2 class="fh5co-heading">N Eye Logo</h2>
						<p>As mentioned earlier, any shade of the colors blue to olive green will always catch my attention. When I did this design, for some reason I kept thinking of the color teal. So I ended up getting my Eye Logo once again, and decided to input that teal color in a darker shade, and work with the letter 'N'. It is not much of a difference but I discovered a new colorway. The missing piece from my name was finally inputted in the Eye Logo, although it was done differently. Instead of having the 'V' & 'A', I had the 'N'. Perhaps it was something that I saw, that encouraged me to do this colorway and 'N' design. </p>
